Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
This repository, datasciencecoursera, hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's course "Getting and Cleaning data", available in coursera.

The dataset used is: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 


Files:

The code takes for granted all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.

CodeBook.md  describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

Run_analysis.R  contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

The output of the 5th step is called  tidy_dataset.txt , and uploaded in the course project's form.
